# todo-list-Node-js
Built a todo list with Node JS, EJS, Express JS and mongo db, also added the "delete" functionality.
Pages can also be generated dynamically for different type of tasks. E.g "localhost://3000/work", ""localhost://3000/training"...
Comments have been placed in the app.js to tell what each block of code does 
All the node modules and dependencies required can be seen in the app.js file.
Opted to use the live date function from the date.js as a listTitle instead.
Also declared it with the "Let" keyword and left it as a global scope variable instead. "Const" throws an error.
A bug fix i hope to fix soon.

The delete functionality still needs work.

Used lodash to prevent errors when changing urls
